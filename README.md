# SCI-MX Client Project

This React and Firebase project was created in collaboration with Ross Richardson and Gemma Peakman from SCIMX and the Fiji intake from the \_nology software development course.

## Brief
The students were given the freedom to create the application from this brief given by Gemma, and Ross.

> Create inspiration in the industry by developing a workout library for our audience that promotes the Sci Mx shop and Social channels. Rewarding and promoting brand loyalty.

## Overview

The project ran for a month with a different student taking the lead and becoming project owner for each weekly sprint. Each day started with a standup and each sprint would end with a demo to the clients. The students used Trello to manage their productivity. Writing out user stories, assigning them and estimating them following a Kanban workflow.

The application was protoyped in Figma and developed using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.
